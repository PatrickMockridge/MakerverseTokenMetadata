	"description": "Hey! I'm Nicholette aka YungRamen (facebook.com/plebmilk) aka 97numb (soundcloud.com/plebmilk). I'm 22 and currently live in Tampa, Florida. I've been a VaporWave artist for 8 years, starting out on Facebook when I was just 14. VaporWave is about escapism and nostalgia: creating aesthetics that help to empathise with everyone's modern day struggles, the hard work, uncertainty, depression, claustrophobia... and yearning for the possibilities and opportunities of times past. I'm super excited to work with Makerverse, it's about giving my generation more opportunities and a way to escape their struggles in a positive way. It's about us owning the technology instead of being controlled by it. I totally feel that 'heart energy' that Patrick talks about on the Founders' tokens. Without heart and awareness, we are lost. To be free, to dream the American Dream and open ourselves to our inner potential, we need to free our hearts and minds. That's what I want my art and my music to do and it's great to be part of the this team, this project and this community.",
