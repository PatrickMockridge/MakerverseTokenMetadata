	"description": "A Special Token given to all those who helped to kickstart the Makerverse journey in the original Telegram chat with our first community-driven marketing exercise. They showed the especially strong heart energy. I think founders' token art should come from the heart, from the imagination. Without the heart energy, we just build everything the same way as before. But with the heart energy, the Founders' energy, we can begin to look to change everything. Those given the SFTs did this in a special way, and this token reflects their special effort. h/t Joao https://t.me/makerverse/4998",
